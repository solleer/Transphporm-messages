# Transphporm-messages
A message holding system for Transphporm

#Use
Check the unit tests to see how to use it.
Note: It is advised to set the message pseudo (ex: `:message[category]`) because if
the css path is the same in setting several messagesthen the last one
overwrites the rest (look at the multiple messages test)
